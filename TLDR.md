The document is a client expectations form for a web design project. The client is looking for a website for their artistic agency, which focuses on dance, singing, and painting, as well as event organization. The desired style is serious, with a dark color palette of black, gray, and white. The website should be simple and intuitive, with a horizontal menu and moderate use of graphics.

Key features of the website include presentation of the agency's services on the homepage, and sections for "About Us", "Organization", "Technique", "Service", "Events", and "Contact". The client prefers a website that is easy to navigate and does not waste their time. They also want the website to be unique and stand out from the competition.

The client provided an example of a website they like, with toned-down colors and easy navigation. They also mentioned that their website should not resemble poorly designed websites with too much information and clutter.

The client does not require a full-width slider image on the homepage and prefers a more graphically rich website, but with a focus on simplicity and intuitive navigation. The contact page should include the agency's contact information, and the footer should contain social media links, a "Find us on the map" link, and the agency's name and year.

The client does not have any specific integration requirements and has no additional remarks or concerns.
